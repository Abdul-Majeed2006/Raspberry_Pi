## 📂 Contents

| File | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Deployment Guide**](./Deployment_and_Main_PY.ipynb) | Notebook | Learn how to make code run on battery power using `main.py`. |
| [**Pico Explorer**](./pico_explorer.py) | Python | A "Swiss Army Knife" menu to test LEDs and buttons without coding. |
