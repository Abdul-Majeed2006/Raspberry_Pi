## 🚀 How to use this workspace

1. **Start with Phase 01**: Familiarize yourself with how to [Deploy](./01_Phase_Essentials/README.md) code to the Pico.
2. **Follow the Numbers**: Each phase builds on the previous one.
3. **Use the Notebooks**: Inside the folders, you'll find `.ipynb` files for deep-dive learning and `.py` files for practical code.

Happy Coding! 🏙️📡
