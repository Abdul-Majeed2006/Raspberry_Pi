    "Welcome to the **Human Interface** deep dive. You have a mechanical switch in your hand—two metal pins and a spring. It seems simple, but to a computer, it's a noisy, confusing piece of hardware. \n",

    "### ⬇️ Option A: Pull-Down (Active-High)\n",
    "- **Wiring**: One side of switch to **3.3V**, other side to **GPIO**.\n",

    "- **Logic**: Default is **1**. When you press, it goes to **0**.\n",
    "> **Why use this?** It's safer. If a wire breaks and touches the metal frame of your robot (usually GND), nothing pops. It's also more resistant to electronic noise."
