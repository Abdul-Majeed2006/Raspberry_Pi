# 🛰️ Phase 05: System Integration

This is the "Final Boss" of the curriculum. Here, we combine everything we've learned into a single, complex system.

## 🚀 The Master Project: AWD Truck Dashboard
Your goal is to build a fully mobile AWD truck that displays its speed, direction, and "mood" on the OLED screen in real-time.

## 🎯 Integration Goals
1.  **Parallel Tasks**: Running motor logic and screen updates simultaneously.
2.  **Telemetry**: Displaying internal data (like speed) on the visual interface.
3.  **Full Deployment**: Packaging the final code into `main.py` for standalone operation.
