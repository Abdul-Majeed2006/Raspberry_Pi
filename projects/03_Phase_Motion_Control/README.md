# 🏎️ Phase 03: Motion Control

Time to get moving! This phase covers how to control DC motors using H-bridge drivers like the L298N.

## 📂 Contents
- **Motor Lessons**: Forward, Backward, and Turning logic.
- **Speed Control**: Using PWM to control how fast the robot moves.
- **AWD Physics**: The logic behind driving 4 wheels simultaneously.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
1.  **H-Bridge Bridge**: Understand how a motor driver acts as a bridge between the Pico and high-voltage batteries.
2.  **Polarity**: Learn how swapping the voltage direction changes the motor's spin.
3.  **Safety**: Understand the importance of common ground and external power.
