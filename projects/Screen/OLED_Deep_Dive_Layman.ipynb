    "**Hexadecimal** (Base-16) is just a short-cut that makes Binary easier for humans to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0x` is a signal that says: \"The next characters are Hex!\"\n",
    "- It uses 0-9 and then **A, B, C, D, E, F** to reach 16.\n",

    "- **The Values (Yes!):** You **can** change the *answer* you send to that slot. If you send `0x00` to the contrast slot, the screen goes dark. If you send `0xFF`, it goes bright."
