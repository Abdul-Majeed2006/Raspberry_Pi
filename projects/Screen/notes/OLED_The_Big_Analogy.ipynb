    "- **The Factory Code:** The Sony engineers decided the Volume Button sends the signal **129** (which is `0x81` in Hex).\n",
    "- **Can you change this?** No. If you try to send the signal **130**, the TV will just ignore you because it wasn't built to listen to 130 for volume.\n",

    "`SET_CONTRAST = 0x81` (129) is just us telling the Pico: \"Hey, when I want to change brightness, I'm going to use the **Button #129** because that's what the factory built into the screen.\"\n",
