# 🌡️ Phase 04: Environment Sensing

*The Physics of the Real World.*

In this phase, we move beyond simple buttons and LEDs. We learn to measure the physical world: Temperature, Light, and safety hazards.

> **Engineering Note:** We do NOT use "Module Boards" (like KY-013) here. We build circuits from scratch or use professional Bus Protocols (I2C) to understand the underlying engineering.

## 📂 Structure
- [**Lessons/**](./lessons/) : Learning to read Analog Physics and Digital Data.
- [**Notes/**](./notes/) : Circuit Theory (Voltage Dividers, ADC Resolution).

## 🎯 Learning Goals
1.  **Internal Sensors**: Using the RP2040's built-in CPU Temperature sensor.
2.  **ADC & Voltage Dividers**: Building a Light Sensor from a raw Photoresistor + Resistor.
3.  **Digital Communication**: Reading data from advanced sensors via I2C (Preparation for System Integration).
4.  **Control Logic**: "If This Then That" - Using data to trigger actions (e.g., Turn on fan if hot).
