# Contributing to the Raspberry Pi Pico Mastery Course

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this curriculum. It's people like you that make learning resources great.

## ⚡ How Can You Help?

1.  **Fixing Bugs:** Found a typo in a lesson? Circuit diagram unclear? Open a PR.
2.  **Improving Documentation:** If a concept is confusing, simple explanations are gold.
3.  **New Examples:** Have a cool way to use the hardware we cover? Share it.

## 🛑 Rules of the Road

### 1. Match the Style
We write for **Engineers**, not toddlers.
- **Tone:** Professional, direct, encouraging.
- **Code:** Clean, commented, PEP-8 compliant.
- **Structure:** Follow the existing folder structure (`lessons`, `notes`, `library`).

### 2. No "Spaghetti Code"
If you submit code, it must be modular. We teach systems engineering here.
- avoid `global` variables where possible.
- Use Classes for hardware components.

### 3. Submission Process
1.  **Fork** the repo.
2.  **Create a Branch** (`git checkout -b fix/amazing-feature`).
3.  **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`).
4.  **Push** to the branch.
5.  **Open a Pull Request**.
