# Raspberry Pi Pico: Physical Computing & Engineering 🚥🎓

Welcome to the **Mastery-Level Pico Curriculum**. This repository is a comprehensive guide designed to take students from absolute zero to building integrated, intelligent hardware systems.

Instead of just "learning to code," this course focuses on **Engineering Thinking**—teaching the 'Why' behind every signal, loop, and object.

## 🚀 The Learning Path
To get the most out of this course, we recommend the following sequence:
1.  **Prep**: Follow the **[Setup Guide](projects/Setup_Guide.md)** to configure your environment.
2.  **Theory**: Read the **[Technical Library](#-technical-library)** below to understand how the hardware "thinks."
3.  **Practice**: Dive into the **[Project Library](#-project-library)** to build your first system.

---

## 📚 Technical Library
*Theory before Practice.* Deep-dive notes on the science and engineering behind the hardware.

*   **[Component Signals](Technical_Notes/Component_Signals.md)**: Understanding Digital vs. Analog vs. PWM.
*   **[Perception & Gamma](projects/LED/07_Perception_and_Gamma.md)**: Why computers and humans see light differently.
*   **[Motor Control Theory](Technical_Notes/08_Motor_Control_Theory.md)**: H-Bridges, Power Isolation, and Safety.
*   **[Differential Drive Logic](Technical_Notes/09_Differential_Drive_Logic.md)**: The Geometry of Turing.
*   **[Deployment & Standalone](projects/Deployment_and_Main_PY.md)**: Taking your projects "off the leash."
