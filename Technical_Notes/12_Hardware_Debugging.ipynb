    "Sometimes, a specific GPIO pin on your Pico can stop functioning. \n",
    "- **Cause**: Static electricity, accidental short circuits, or internal manufacturing flaws.\n",
    "- **Symptom**: Code runs perfectly, LEDs blink on the Pico, but no signal arrives at the component.\n",
    "- **Fix**: **Signal Relocation.** Simply move your wire to a fresh GPIO pin (e.g., GP9 or GP16) and update your code mapping."
