# Raspberry Pi Pico: Physical Computing Course 🎛️

Welcome to the **hands-on** guide to microcontroller programming. This isn't a theory course—you'll be controlling real hardware from Chapter 1.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Control LEDs, motors, and relays (Digital Output)
- Dim lights and mix colors (PWM / Analog Output)
- Read buttons and switches (Digital Input)
- Read sensors and potentiometers (Analog Input)
- Build interactive physical systems (Games, Gadgets)

## Course Structure

The course is divided into **6 progressive chapters**:

1. **[01_Hello_Pico.ipynb](01_Hello_Pico.ipynb)** - Introduction, Pinout, Your First Blink
2. **[02_Breathing_LEDs.ipynb](02_Breathing_LEDs.ipynb)** - PWM and Fading Effects
3. **[03_Mastering_Colors.ipynb](03_Mastering_Colors.ipynb)** - RGB LEDs and Color Mixing
4. **[04_Inputs_and_Interaction.ipynb](04_Inputs_and_Interaction.ipynb)** - Buttons and User Control
5. **[05_Advanced_Sensors.ipynb](05_Advanced_Sensors.ipynb)** - Analog Inputs and Sensors
6. **[06_Game_Project.ipynb](06_Game_Project.ipynb)** - Final Project: Reaction Timer Game

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
1. **Hardware** - See [Hardware_List.md](Hardware_List.md) for the shopping list
2. **Software** - See [Setup_Guide.md](Setup_Guide.md) for installation instructions
3. **Your brain** - Ready for some fun problem-solving

## How to Use This Course

1. **Work sequentially** - Each chapter builds on the previous one
2. **Do the exercises** - They're integrated throughout, not just at the end
3. **Experiment** - If something breaks, unplug and try again. You won't fry it easily
4. **Build your own projects** - Once you finish Ch 6, the sky's the limit
