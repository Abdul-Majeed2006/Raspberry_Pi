# PICO PHYSICAL COMPUTING: THE RGB SYLLABUS 🎓🚥

This curriculum is designed to take students from absolute zero to building integrated, intelligent hardware systems.

## PHASE 1: THE FUNDAMENTALS
*   **01 Architecture**: Understanding the "Brain" (Pico) and the "Nervous System" (Pins).
*   **02 Signals**: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and simple blinking.
*   **03 Sound**: Frequency modulation and audible feedback.
*   **04 Analog**: Reading the physical world with Knobs (ADC).
*   **05 Perception**: The Gamma Correction secret (Human vs. Computer).

## PHASE 2: INTEGRATED DESIGN
*   **06 State Machines**: Building the 4-phase Intelligent Traffic Light.
*   **07 Interaction**: Using multi-knob input to drive sound and light simultaneously.

## PHASE 3: THE MASTERY SERIES
1.  **Hue Mapping**: Translating 1D input into the 3D Rainbow spectrum.
2.  **Game Logic**: Building the "Combination Safe" avec haptic feedback.
3.  **BPM Math**: Creating a professional Digital Metronome.
4.  **Data Encoding**: Broadcasting Morse Code via Dictionaries.
5.  **Reflexes**: Measuring millisecond precision in the Reaction Game.
6.  **Organic Lighting**: Mastering Sine waves in the Mood Lantern.
7.  **Variable Mixing**: Linking sound pitch to visual intensity.

## PHASE 4: DEPLOYMENT
*   **main.py**: Taking the robot off the leash and running standalone on batteries.
